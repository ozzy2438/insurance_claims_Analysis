## Visualizations

The dashboard includes four main visualizations aligned with stakeholder priorities:

1. **Cost Factors Analysis**: Multi-variable chart showing which factors have the greatest impact on total claim costs, addressing the question "What factors increase total claim costs?"

2. **Fraud Detection Scorecard**: Heatmap/matrix showing fraud probability by key factor combinations, addressing the question "Can we develop a reliable scorecard to detect fraudulent claims early?"

4. **Premium Optimization Model**: Comparison chart showing current vs. optimized premium models, supporting the goal to "optimize premium pricing"
